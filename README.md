Atmo is a framework designed for building function-based web services using any language. Building web services should be simple, and Atmo makes it easy to define your business logic wihout needing to worry about scalability, infrastructure, or even choosing the wrong language.

Atmo enables you to write small self-contained functions in a variety of laguages, define your business logic by declaritvely composing them, and then automatically scales out a flat network of instances to handle traffic using a meshed message bus and an embedded job scheduler. No need to write boilerplate ever again.

Atmo is currently in pre-alpha stages, and is the flagship project in the Suborbital Development Platform. Atmo is built atop [Vektor](github.com/suborbital/vektor), [Hive](github.com/suborbital/hive) and [Grav](github.com/suborbital/grav)
