Atmo Beta-2.3 brings a few great improvements:
- AssemblyScript support! You can now build Runnables with TypeScript syntax. Use Subo v0.0.16 or later with the `subo create runnable awesomefn --lang typescript` command.
- 'Headless mode': Running Atmo with the `ATMO_HEADLESS=true` env var puts Atmo in headless mode, which causes it to ignore your directive and make each individual Runnable available at its own unique URL. This is extremely useful for testing, since you have full control over the inputs to the Runnable.

As always, there are large under-the-hood changes in this release that will allow Atmo to evolve faster and support future features! Beta-3 is still in progress, with the headline feature still set to be GraphQL client support for accessing your databases!
