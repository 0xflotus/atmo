Beta-2.2 brings a number of small improvements:

- Atmo can now be launched without a bundle present using either the `--wait` flag or the `ATMO_WAIT=true` variable. This allows a bundle to be uploaded after-the-fact, facilitating deployments like the new experimental [Kubernetes deployment](https://github.com/suborbital/atmo-k8s-helm)
- Atmo's HTTP port configuration is now respected by the LetsEncrypt challenge server, with the new default port set to 8080.
- During startup, Atmo's logs will now be more helpful.
