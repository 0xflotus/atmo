## Welcome to Atmo Beta-3!
There are some great new additions in this release, let's get an overview:

### Streams
Streams are a new handler type in Atmo. You can define a `stream` handler that reads messages from a streaming connection such as a websocket or NATS topic, and execute your Runnables to handle each one. This opens up tons of new use-cases and application architecture patterns that Atmo can now be a part of!

### Authentication
Your Directive can now configure authentication secrets for your Runnables' HTTP and GraphQL requests. Atmo will automatically inject `Authorization` headers into requests made by your code so that secrets are handled securely by the runtime instead of being passed into the WebAssembly sandbox.

### Connections
External connections can now be defined declaratively in the Directive to automatically set up resources that your application needs to operate. Configuring NATS for stream processing, and in the future, connections like caches and databases can now be defined declaratively instead of needing to set them up in code.

### GraphQL capability
As alluded to above, your Runnables can now make GraphQL requests! Popoular third-party APIs rely on GraphQL, and your Atmo applications can now work seamlessly with them.

There's a ton more under the hood, but that covers the highlights! As always, visit the [documentation](https://atmo.suborbital.dev) for the most up-to-date information and getting started guide.
